### Typical Problem 
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Minimum Spanning Tree Problem (MSP)

### Method to solve combinational optimization problem (universal approaches)
1. *Branch-and-bound*
		`find and compute the lower bound of each node and select a node with the lowest lower bound value then repeat`
2. *Branch-and-cut*
3. *Dynamic programming*
4. *Genetic algorithms*
5. *Tabu search*
6. *Generic search
